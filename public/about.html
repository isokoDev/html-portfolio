<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Isoko Precious, a multifaceted professional with a passion for innovation, rhythm, and connection. With a background in biochemistry, a thriving side hustle as a DJ, and a sharp edge in web development, I bring science, art, and tech together in everything I do.
</p>
<h2>Biochemist by Day</h2>
<p>With a strong academic foundation in biochemistry, I'm driven by curiosity and committed to understanding the molecular mechanics of life. My work spans from research and lab analysis to translating complex scientific concepts into actionable solutions. I thrive on problem-solving and contributing to meaningful advancements in health and science.
</p>
<h2>DJ by Night</h2>
<p>Music is my creative release and my way of connecting with people on a deeper level. As a DJ, I blend genres and vibes to create unforgettable experiences. Whether I'm spinning at local clubs, private events, or curated sets for online audiences, I bring energy, style, and authenticity to every performance.
</p>
<h2>Web Developer Always</h2>
<p>I'm also a self-taught (and continuously learning) web developer passionate about building functional, beautiful, and user-centered digital experiences. From portfolio sites to dynamic apps, I love crafting solutions that merge clean design with smooth interactivity. Tech is where I bring my creative and analytical minds together.
</p>
<h2> Beyond Work: Sports, Travel & People
</h2>
<p>When I'm not in the lab, behind the decks, or coding my next project, you'll find me out in the world—playing or watching sports, traveling to new places, and meeting people from all walks of life. I live for new experiences, spontaneous adventures, and meaningful conversations.
</p>
<h2> What Drives Me
</h2>
<p>At the core, I'm a connector—of ideas, cultures, disciplines, and people. I believe in living fully, learning constantly, and bringing my whole self to every table I sit at.
